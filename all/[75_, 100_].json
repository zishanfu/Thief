Once the weathered stonework design has been carved into the foam and the stone texture has been applied it is then give a coat of a sealer to protect the foam and to make it more durable.

I can make a wall or floor tile with just about the same amount of work. I don't need to have orders in the 1,000+ quantity in the way some other companies would need to. They do this to keep the cost as low as possible, but I have no minimum order numbers to hit. The other advantage is I can make some really crazy exotic tiles in low runs that you would never see from one of the larger companies because of minimum order numbers.", "Because of this, I was able to create some Pledge Rewards I think you are really going to love.", "For this campaign, I will have three brackets of pledge rewards.", "First, we have the Add-on Pledge. I wanted to make it to where you could purchase any type of tile that you wanted to buy. Instead of having to buy massive amounts of certain types of tiles to get the ones you want, you can just buy each tile that you need. Many players like to have longer rooms with more walls while others may prefer big massive floor mats for epic fights with Dragons and Giants. If you have ever wanted to build your own set they way you wanted then this reward level is for you. And the best part about doing things at this tier level is you pay the same price for the tiles as you would if you purchased them in a set!", "The Add-on Pledge is super simple. Go to the Add-on section of the Kickstarter and find the tiles you want. Add up the cost of those tiles and then select the Add-on Pledge option. Then enter the total cost of the tiles you want to purchase. After the campaign ends I will send out a survey allowing you to select which tiles you wanted. That's it!", "Second is the \"One Set\" level. After using Dungeon Tiles for years this is what I would consider the base level set. A base set includes 13 Floor Tiles, 9 Wall Tiles, and 9 Corner tiles. This is the basic set. You will get a nearly even mix of A and B sets. If you want to purchase specific tiles you will be able to do this through the add-on pledge. You can also add-on individual tiles to a base one and two set pledge.", "Mix of both A and B sets.", "This is a great introduction set for premium gaming tiles. If you are just getting started or are looking to add a small set to your already massive collection then this set is for you. With this set, you can also add any number of tiles or specialty pieces that you want during the pledge manager after the campaign ends!", "The third option is the \"Two Set\" level. This set has everything that the \"One Set\" level has double portions! It comes with 26 Floor Tiles, 18 Wall Tiles, and 18 Corner Tiles. This Pledge Level allows you to build large massive rooms and caverns that will awe your players. If you are looking to really up your collection of tiles or start out with a bang, this is the set for you. You will get a mix of A and B sets. And just like the other two Pledge Levels, you can Add-on tiles or specialty pieces during the Pledge Manager!", "Each Pledge is locked to a maximum amount of orders. For the Add-ons and \"One Set\" Pledges that is 30 orders. For the \"Two Set\" Pledges that would be 20 orders. Because I make all of the tiles in-house this is the maximum that I can make and ship on time. To be able to accommodate as many backers as possible I may create additional waves, but they would be 3-4 months later.", "The Last Pledge option is the Artisan Package. This pledge reward is limited to 5 backers, and I will not open additional waves for it. With this pledge level, I will make a custom tile of your choosing. After the campaign, we will discuss what you are dreaming of over email and I will get to work creating it in amazing Ice Cavern clarity! It will be made out of the same materials and in the same way as my normal tiles. I will include the Clay model and 3d models I used to make it as well as a handful of Ice Cavern versions of the tile!", "This is your opportunity to really dig in and go hog wild! You dream it and I will make it for you. Please keep it reasonable on size, ( and it has to be terrain of some type) but other than that the world is your oyster.", "In addition to this, the pledge reward comes with two base sets of Ice Caverns and ships in May instead of June so you get your tiles a month before everyone else!", "Add-ons are dead simple. If you back at any Pledge Level then you can add any amount of extra tiles for the cost listed above. \"One Set\" and 3 additional Corner Tiles = $126.00 ( $114 for the Set and $12 for the additional three tiles ) All tiles regardless of sets are the same price. Floor tile C is the same price as Floor Tile A. The Backerkit add-ons will allow you to select whatever tile you want, either A, B or C.

Backers who spend $300+ will receive two free Stalagmites pack in their order!", "Having said that I certainly have some things in the pipeline that I will be showing off in the next few weeks. There are certainly some exciting things coming and I can't wait to show it to you. I have a few Giant surprises in store that I hope we can get to. Some of these sculpts may change the way you think about Dungeon Terrain!", "I estimate these dates at the latest as I am already working on tiles and have been for some time. Hopefully, I will get everyone their product months sooner but if not the listed time is my worse case fall behind scenario.", "Shipping for the base sets is shown in the price. Add-ons are going to be handled differently. Because I don't know what tiles are being ordered until after the Kickstarter ends I have no way to give an accurate price quote. I am working with a USPS rep to keep shipping as low as possible, but I will really need to know through the survey if you are ordering 5 tiles or 500. Thus shipping will be charged through the Pledge Manager for any Add-ons that you purchase. I promise I will keep shipping charges as low as possible. They should remain similar to what I charge for shipping for my base sets, which is $15 and $20.", "And this is one of the best parts of the Kickstarter relaunch for me. International shipping is a go! It took a few months to get everything straightened out, but I can now ship anywhere in the world! Please note, my shipping dates are estimates on when items will be shipped out, they could take a bit longer than the listed months to arrive due to international travel and customs.", "Thanks for reading through that mountain of text and photos! It was fun to share the adventure with you. I wanted to close with a few additional things.", "Minimum funding goal has been lowered significantly compared to the first Kickstarter. The big reason for this is I am not purchasing some or the larger equipment that I would need to ramp up production and I will not be making some of the add-on tiles that I showed before. At least, I don't have to do either of those things. If funding breaks 5K I can start to add some of the add-ons back in. If funding breaks 10K I can grab some more machinery to speed up the process. And then we can go from there.", "Being able to launch first on Kickstarter allows me to offer a substantial discount to backers over what the tiles will sell for later on through my online store. ( approximately 20% ) One of the wonderful things about using Kickstarter as a platform is buying everything as bulk and being able to pass those savings onto backers.", "I own buckets of PVC tiles, and I love them. My gaming group would not be complete without them. I use fantastic 3D printed tiles. I am not putting down any of those material types, nor the fantastic amazing folks who make them. I tried very hard to sing the praises of everyone that has come before me and to impart to you how important each and every one of them has been. So many wonderful creators and companies have given me toys to play with and they are the ones to thank for the tiles I am able to create today.", "So thank you.", "I would be eternally grateful if you would share this page with your friends and groups.

Little Bighorn Rummy is one of those games. The game designer has perfectly mixed critical thinking, strategy, and tactics using simple and light game play. While the objective is always the same, how one gets there is always different. Best of all, tactics and strategies will shift during the game. When a player suddenly draws Custer midway through a hand, they scramble and must refocus and so do the other players. The careful card plays suddenly turn more aggressive and visceral as everyone tries to ditch cards as fast as possible or find that perfect combo for the win. This type of game play was unexpected and greatly pleased me. I highly recommend Little Bighorn Rummy to Child, Parent, and Gamer Geeks who are looking for an engaging Rummy style card game to play at their table.", "See the complete review at", "http://fathergeek.com/"], "ProjectLink": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/929799192/little-bighorn-rummy-0", "totalComments": "20", "popularity": 128, "ProjectTitle": "Little Bighorn Rummy", "CreatedBy": "John Longstreet", "TotalChampaignImage": 17, "ProjectUpdates": {"totalUpdatesBetweenFundedAndShipped": 0, "totalUpdatesAfterShipped": 0, "totalUpdatesBeforeFunded": 3}, "totalVCommentsSample": 13, "ProjectResults": {"current_currency": "USD", "goalFinishedPercentage": "81.0484", "FundedOrNot": "failed", "AmountPledged": "2026.21", "totalBackers": "48", "AmountAsked": "2500.0"}, "ChampaignVideoLink": "https://ksr-video.imgix.net/projects/501998/video-222992-h264_base.mp4?ixlib=rb-1.1.0", "ProjectTimeLine": ["2013-04-23T18:44:12-04:00", "2013-05-27T18:44:12-04:00"], "ChampaignVideo": "True"},

A man named Ben Smythe has created an IFTL\ndrive (Instantaneous Faster-than-light).", "The Kingdom Role-playing System relies on six sided die and\npercentile die. Players can either randomly generate the basic statistics for\ntheir characters or GMs (Game Master) can choose to have a point buy system.\nThen they play through adventures run by the GM where their choices can\ninevitably and sometimes unpredictably have an impact on the galaxy at large.", "The system allows for easy creation of new adventures while\nhaving a large framework for the underlying narrative of the Kingdom universe.\nThe main book will contain many species to use as enemies/allies/players as\nwell as information about technology, planets, ships, and more. GMs will have\nmany tools at their disposal in the book in the form of percentile charts that\nwill allow them to randomize events that happen to their players and can act as\nplot devices. It will also contain a starter adventure for both of the canon\nKingdom scenarios.", "The scenarios are as followed:", "Scenario One (Year One Scenario):", "Ben Smythe's plan was to use a\nprivate space craft that he named after his deceased daughter (", "Charlene", ") and have a crew of\nprofessionals set out into the galaxy for one year. Using public records he was\nable to bring up a list of 20 star systems with a high potential for Earth-like\nplanets. The crew of the", "Charlene", "would then go to these worlds and collect scientific data, life-forms, and\ntechnology if they encounter it. Ben would then use this evidence to prove that\nhis drive was real and found a company to exploit the newfound knowledge. Each\ncrewmember is then guaranteed a percentage of the company.", "In this scenario players would be restricted to human\ncharacters in the beginning of the game. As the game continues on and the\nplayers come into contact with intelligent species on several of these worlds\nthere would be opportunities for them to create alien characters (GM\npermitting). They will eventually encounter the Kingdom, an alien empire that\ncovers most of the Milky Way Galaxy and incorporates thousands of different\ncivilizations as ruled by the race known as the Nobility. This would be the\nmore difficult of the two starting scenarios since the crew would be largely\nrestricted to human technology of 2045 (mostly within the realms of what we\nhave today) which are inferior to much of the alien technology that they\nencounter. The only advantage that humanity has is its IFTL drive which is\nmuch faster than the Kingdom Gate Network which results in trips that can take\nweeks, months, even years between star systems. Research, diplomacy, and\nexploration are stressed more than combat which is much more dangerous for the\nplayers at this point.", "Scenario Two (Aftermath):", "Takes place a year after the\ninitial crew comes back from their journey. Ben Smythes corporation\n(Exotechnology Inc.) is now a massive multi-billion dollar institution. He has\na small fleet of vessels that interact with the Milky Way Galaxy (and beyond)\nfor profit and exploration. They are now a power within their own right within\nthe Galaxy with limited connections to the Kingdom and various smaller\ngovernments. Due to the limitation in producing new drives (Ben Smythe can only\ncreate 12 a year) the Exotechnology corporation is not as wide-spread as most\nalien civilizations. Instead they largely are hired out by either the Kingdom\nor other governments for urgent missions that only IFTL can react to in time.", "In this scenario the players would have access to humans and\nvarious aliens working for the Exotechnology corporation. There would still be\nsome elements of exploration but also with a more focused mission-based\nstructure if they wish. With more developed technology they also are much more\ncapable of combat scenarios that they wouldnt have been able to complete in\nthe previous scenario (at least not until very late game).", "One other unique aspect of this is the ongoing Metagame that\nKingdom will have once funded. This focuses on the Aftermath scenario and\nprovides players/groups that sign up with new ongoing storylines and plot\ndevelopments as the Exotechnology Corporation moves out into the galaxy. This\nwill come in the form of 4 reports delivered by Ben Smythe to the players as if\nthey were Exotechnology stockholders in the year 2046.

Tired of the standard STR, INT, and CON attributes? EVERY VERSE RPG not only provides something new, it feels more natural. Starting with something general, it then cascades into more, and more, specific ones that just seem to flow together. This allows tremendous flexibility by letting you decide how random you want to be plus giving the opportunity to make some adjustments to overcome a bad roll or customize to suit your play style. Tired of cookie cutter classes or overly cumbersome lists? The skills cascade allows you to decide how general or specific you want to be. Also, specialization actually makes a real difference. The limits are only your imagination.\n Rich S., Cedar Rapids, IA", "As the wife of the game designer, I had the privilege of seeing how hard Dennis worked on developing the system. As a play tester, I experienced the fun of creating shared adventures with my husband and friends using this gaming system. We searched for a gaming system that allowed flexibility and found it in EVERYVERSE RPG. The skills cascades plus standard distribution in character generation and outcome determination streamline the rules, allowing focus on the fun.  You never experience no matter what the characters do, they end up here.\n Debra Hoenig Parizek, Fort Madison, IA", "Our group loved trying different milieus but learning every new gaming system that came around was frustrating. Or maybe we wanted to create our own milieu based on a book or movie and a related game system didnt exist. EVERYVERSE RPG solved these problems making it easy for us to create new characters quickly and adopt facets which were applicable to the desired campaign. The standard distribution approach to character traits and skills is so intuitive it makes you wonder why other systems havent come up with it. The skill cascades make character progression very flexible, allowing very general or very specific abilities.\n Jim P., Baltimore, MD", "Playing EVERYVERSE RPG has been a wild ridefrom nobody to terror of the universe. Its absolutely my favorite game system! What I like best about EVERYVERSE RPG is that if you can imagine it, you can play it. Its a game system where the rules facilitate play, unlike other role playing games that limit imagination and bog down in looking up rules and endless dice rolling. EVERYVERSE RPG is about creating shared stories and adventures.

I've played fantasy role playing games for 30 years and both tabletop miniatures and trading card games since they came out. My gaming history has led me to make this game a reality! everyone I talk to about it gets excited! (even if you cant back this project please share this page to help get it done!.) It's a simple board game with many rpg elements, including finding and using magic items and using gold to boost abilities! Hundreds of cards make it never the same game twice! play as an elf, dwarf, human, pixie, centaur or giant! ultimately you must defeat the goblin king! We are play testing now to work out the kinks. We need funding to print up boards and cards Honestly the more funding we get the nicer it will be, but i see 2 main versions: Standard Edition. ...Which has the board, 6 character tokens, 6 character sheets, 6 20-sided dice, 50 marker tokens, 100 adventure cards, 100 treasure cards and the standard rulebook. The Deluxe Edition would have 2 boards(or double-sided), 8 character tokens, 8 character sheets (the 6 mentioned earlier plus an angel and a demon!), 8 20-sided dice, 100 marker tokens, 200 adventure cards, 200 treasure cards and the deluxe rulebook. (featuring alternate game rules) also I mention elsewhere a Super Deluxe Edition.

When a players deck has run out and they need to draw a card, they simply shuffle their discard pile and it becomes their new draw deck.

The Order was a collective of adept magical enthusiasts who for centuries collaborated in secret to tame and refine their arcane magical knowledge. Zeverith quickly became aware of the Order's existence through his network of spies and immediately swore to neutralize them. Many of its members were killed by Zeveriths forces but others fled deep into the depths of long forgotten caverns - some of the more masterful wizards even managed to magically construct artificial planes of existence to escape off into. In response, Zeverith began what would come to be known as The Great Purge, sending his men from city to city and town to town to hunt down every last wizard. As part of a poor group of peasants from a small quiet town on the outskirts of the Kingdom, you suddenly found yourself swept up in The Purge when a group of Zeveriths men stormed your town, murdered the townsfolk, and burned every last house to the ground.
